\f0\fs24 \cf0 After careful evaluation and consideration, I have decided that the app should look less like the Invisible Ink app already installed by default with the Messages app.\

The new plan is to open a new Messages window of my own design, which appears in the expanded presentation style. The user enters text, the image is created and sent. On the sender's side, the message appears as typed. On the recipient side, the deciphered image. The transcript will simply be a table of two columns and an ever-expanding number of rows.}
